# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the static assets for the project:

## Structure

- `images/`: For all image assets
  - `blog/`: Blog post images
  - `team/`: Team member photos
  - `services/`: Service-related images
  
- `icons/`: For custom icons (SVG format)
  - `services/`: Service-specific icons
  - `social/`: Social media icons

## Usage Guidelines

1. Image formats:
   - Use .jpg for photographs
   - Use .png for images requiring transparency
   - Use .svg for icons and logos

2. Naming convention:
   - Use kebab-case (e.g., team-member-1.jpg)
   - Be descriptive (e.g., service-design-hero.jpg)

3. Image optimization:
   - Compress images before adding
   - Use appropriate resolutions
   - Consider responsive image sizes

4. Version control:
   - Only commit optimized images
   - Avoid frequent changes to images
